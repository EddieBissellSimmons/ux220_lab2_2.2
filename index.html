        I am somewhat of a nerd. I enjoy playing tabletop roleplaying games such
        as dungeons and dragons with my friends. Along with sitting around a
        table having a grand ol' time with my friends there is a LOT of books
        that add various rules and character options that we have all read and
        actively reference as we play.

        Recently, I have been playing Pathfinder 2e, another tabletop
        roleplaying game similar to dungeons and dragons. With all of this in
        mind the best book I have read recently was the Pathfinder Core
        Rulebook. I enjoyed reading it for two main reasons: the writing style
        and the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, the writing style. The rulebook is written in two main parts,
        the player section and the game master section. The player section is
        written very concisely and gives players a good mental picture of what
        The game looks like it is in play. The game master section is written as
        a collection of helpful tips from other game masters which means the
        writing is very applicable and answers lots of questions game masters
        might have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, the content, which is arguably the most important part. The
        Core Rulebook contains everything a player and the game master would I
        need to know to start playing instantly. This may seem like a normal
        thing, but in the world of tabletop roleplaying games, like D&D, all the
        information to start playing instantly is split up into THREE different
        books. This is not only more financially advantageous but it is also
        easier to not have to look through three books at the same time.
